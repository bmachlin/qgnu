            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
                I recently bought a spiffy new computer and decided that <em>this time I'll do things right</em>. 
                I'll keep my files tidy. I'll understand my Python setup and keep it organized. I'll only install 
                software that I need and keep it all on a short leash......Yeah you can guess how well it's going haha. 
                Ok it's not a total failure (yet) but it turns out I don't have the time/desire to keep my computer as 
                perfect as I'd like it. And unlike an apartment, you can't really hire someone to come around every 
                so often and do it for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                One task that I'm actually trying to get right it my music library. It's not that it was entirely messy 
                but there were/are ample inconsistencies and I always figured I ought to put my programming skills to 
                use here and iron out those issues. Most of them are metadata nitpicks anyway. Why not get a little DIY 
                with it and chisel my library just to my liking.
            </p>
            <h4>Music Metadata</h4>
            <p>
                There are many articles on audio formats, and metadata formats, and the history and details of all of them. 
                Here I'm just going to focus on one audio encoding and it's most popular metadata tagging standard: MP3 and ID3.
                <a href="http://www.mp3developments.com/article8.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This short article provides a great intro.</a>
                Basically, after they made MP3, someone thought it'd be nifty to tack on a little metadata (e.g. artist, album, year) 
                to the end of the files. This was ID3v1. But it was a static block of 128 bytes and there was a ton more 
                metadata music and tech nerds wanted to associate with each MP3. Thus the ID3v2 standard was created and  
                allowed for a lot more flexibility and extensibility. That was back in the 1990s/early 2000s. Now, 20-something 
                years later, in a 7th or 8th effort to organize my music library, I'm learning the nuance of ID3.

        <section id="id3v2-basics">
            <a href="#id3v2-basics"><h3>ID3v2 Basics</h3></a>
            <p>
                Reference material:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID3v2.3 Spec</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID3v2.4 Spec</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After doing some research online and looking at my existing ~20k file library, I've determined that ID3v2 is 
                the de facto MP3 tagging standard, and further, version 2.3 is a bit more ubiquitous than 2.4. Most other 
                versions of ID3 and other tagging standards are less common and I will ignore for my purposes. 2.3 and 2.4 
                aren't all too different, but differ enough that support for 2.4 isn't a given. I'll focus on 2.3 here, though 
                I expect 2.4 might sneak in here and there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic structure of an ID3v2.3 tag is this:
            </p>
            <ol style="font-family: monospace;">
                <li>
                    Header
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tag is usually at the beginning of the MP3 file and starts with the bytes "ID3"</li>
                        <li>Two bytes for the version</li>
                        <ul><li>2.3 is represented as "03 00"</li></ul>
                        <li>One byte for flags</li>
                        <li>Four bites for the total size of the tag, not including this header</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Body
                    <ul>
                        <li>Series of frames, each with a frame header and frame data</li>
                        <li>Padding</li>
                        <ul><li>Padding is included so that if more tag data is added, it's less 
                            likely that the file needs to be resized - which is time consuming and 
                            tag editting is often done in bulk
                        </li></ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Frames are made up of a short header and a data body:
            </p>
            <ol style="font-family: monospace;">
                <li>
                    Header
                    <ul>
                        <li>Four bytes/characters for frame ID, e.g. TALB, APIC</li>
                        <li>Four bites for size</li>
                        <li>Two bytes for flags</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data bytes
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To demonstrate these basics, I made a tag with only a song title and artist:
                <br><img src="../res/blug/tag_example_1.png"><br>
                The artist is "Ben!" (TPE1) and the title is "Test Song" (TIT2). I've yet to figure out 
                why the text fields start with 01. The tag size is 2104 bytes, but everything after the 
                song title is just padding. If you know your 
                character encodings, you might've figured out that this tag is in UTF-16. The spec doesn't 
                mention anything about encodings but for whatever reason 2.3 uses either UTF-16 or ISO-8859-1
                and 2.4 uses UTF-8.
            </p>

        <section id="my-goal">
            <a href="#my-goal"><h3>My Goal</h3></a>
            <h4>High Level Goal</h4>
            <p>
                My goal is to create an automated pipeline through which I can send all my music (as well as 
                new music I acquire) that conforms it to my personal standards. Imagine a logging machine 
                that takes raw tree trunks, shaves them, cuts them, and labels them. Lucky for me, my music 
                isn't as organizationally complex as it could be. I have almost exlcusively: albums, partial 
                albums, singles, and compilations. I feel bad for classical music nerds! Here are my 
                requirements - roughly in order of importance:
            </p>   
            <ol style="background-color:rgb(221, 221, 221)"> 
                <li>Album is always filled in and identical across an album</li>
                <ul><li>Singles' album names should be the name of the single</li></ul>
                <li>Album Artist is always filled in and identical across an album</li>
                <ul><li>This is often equal to the Artist</li></ul>
                <li>Album art should always be filled in and identical across an album</li>
                <li>Year should always be filled in and identical across an album</li>
                <ul><li>This can be a little tricky for Greatest Hits record, 
                    or songs on a single album came out in different years</li></ul>
                <li>Genre is always filled in and identical across an album</li>
                <ul><li>This only has to be kinda accurate. Lots of music can't be describe by a single genre.</li></ul>
                <li>Any songs with a feature should be tagged like so: "Song Name (feat. Other Person)"</li>
                <ul><li>Note the feature details are in the song title and the artist should remain unaffected</li></ul>
                <li>Track number should always be filled in</li>
                <li>Unless part of a multi-disc album, disc number, total discs, and total tracks should be null</li>
                <li>Lyrics should ideally be filled in</li>
            </ol>
            <p>    
                As you can see, consistency across an album is important to me - especially because some music 
                players have a tendency to split your albums if certain fields aren't uniform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's also do a quick check to see what the approximate size of each tag would be if everything 
                fit my requirements. I ran the numbers on my existing library to get approximations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Album name, 18 characters => 36 bytes + 10 for header => 46 bytes</li>
                <li>Track name, 23 characters ==> 56 bytes</li>
                <li>Artist name (x2 for album artist), 13 characters ==> 36 bytes x2 = 72 bytes</li>
                <li>Year, 14 bytes</li>
                <li>Genre, 10 characters, 30 bytes</li>
                <li>Album art, wildly guessing 80,000 bytes</li>
                <li>Track number, 13 bytes</li>
                <li>Lyrics, 40 characters per line, 40 lines, 3210 bytes</li>
                <li>Other misc tags, 500 bytes</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Total = 83941 bytes = 0.08MB per tag, which is about 1/100th the size of an avergae mp3. 
                Sounds good to me.
            </p>
            <h4>Attempts</h4>
            <p>
                My first attempt was with <a href="https://beets.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beets</a>.
                It's a music tagging CLI/Python package. It integrates with Picard, is tenured and has an 
                active community. I thought my journey might start and end here. Alas, I found that it doesn't 
                always get the right match from Picard (which would totally mess up your tag) and when it does, 
                there's often at least one field that doesn't seem right. Getting it to match my requirements 
                felt like more effort than writing something myself. While I still think it's super useful, I'm 
                not sure it's for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided that even if I'll eventually want to fetch tag data from an API, there's still plenty of 
                the "cleaning" I can do with a script. For example, a lot of the "identical across an album" requirements 
                are just a matter of fixing outliers. Being the typical Python developer, I googled "python music 
                tagging library". I found my way to <a href="https://eyed3.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyed3</a> 
                and started messing around in a jupyter notebook. I played around (read: struggled) for a while 
                trying to properly read and save tags but faced a lot of friction. Then I found a better solution - 
                <a href="https://mutagen.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutagen</a> which beets 
                actually uses for its tagging.

                If you're into computer stuff, you probably know the struggle of keeping accurate metadata.<br>
                If you're into music and have a digital library, you definitely know the struggle of keeping 
                accurate metadata.<br>If you're into computer stuff and music and have a digital library, you 
                might've wandered a similar path to the one I'm on now: Using your computer skills to organize 
                your music library.<br>You've seen enough albums split in two in ITunes. You've been frustrated 
                when all but one track on an album has album art. You've been disheartened when half 
                your library has a year, a third has a genre, and a quarter of those are correct. And maybe 
                one day with a bunch of time to kill you thought "I could probably write a script to clean 
                up this mess".
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I am now, not with a perfectly organized library (spoiler: there's no such thing), but 
                with a piqued interest. I've been working on creating a pipeline through which I can shove 
                all my music and any new music I acquire such that everything will come out neat and sparkling 
                - or as close as I can it. I fumbled around with a few technologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://beets.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beets</a></li>
                <ul><li>CLI and Python package that has a lot of music tagging automation built in</li></ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mp3Tag</a></li>
                <ul><li>Long standing Windows program that helps with (bulk) tag editting, no CLI/package</li></ul>
                <li><a href="https://eyed3.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyed3</a></li>
                <ul><li>Python package for reading/writing mp3 tags</li></ul>
                <li><a href="https://mutagen.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutagen</a></li>
                <ul><li>Python package for reading/writing mp3 tags</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'll spare you the details and just say that in the end, I'm planning on using mutagen with 
                some support from Mp3Tag. The interesting part comes from what I had to dig into to understand 
                the files I'm working with. MP3s don't have metadata built into the specification. Instead 
                there's a little thing called ID3 that <em>tags</em> along with each MP3 to provide metadata.
            </p>
            <p>
                One interesting thing about ID3 is that there is a spec, but there's nothing impelling a 
                program to follow it to a tee if it doesn't want to. Tons of music players don't support 
                every aspect of ID3 but nothing blows up. Not every program that tags MP3s with ID3s 
                will do so in the same way. There are several ways to achieve similar results. Really, it's 
                up to the user to either a) make sure their files are tagged in a way that their music 
                player(s) of choice will interpret the metadata correctly, and/or b) pick music player(s) 
                that correctly intepret their music library as it's tagged.
